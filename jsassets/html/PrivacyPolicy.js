</ol>
<p>5.1. Sharing between Customers and Couriers</p>
<p>When Couriers are offered delivery opportunities, they may be able to see the Customer’s delivery location. Once a Courier accepts a delivery request from a Customer, the Customer can see the Courier’s first name and last initial and the Courier can see the Customer’s first name and last initial. A Customer is also able to see a Courier’s photo, aggregate rating, and other information to identify the Courier, including, but not limited to the Courier’s license plate, and color, make, and model of vehicle. During a delivery, the Customer in some instances is able to see the Courier’s real-time location, and the Courier may be able to see the Customer’s delivery address and/or real-time location. During a delivery, Customers and Couriers are able to call and text each other. Customer and Courier phone numbers are masked and, only in rare instances, may they be able to see the other’s phone number. As described above, Customers are able to see a Courier’s aggregate ratings during a delivery. After a delivery, we may share feedback or comments that a Customer provides with a Courier, but we will not identify the Customer. We may also share with Couriers their aggregate ratings.</p>
<p>5.2. Sharing between Couriers and Merchants</p>
<p>Before a Courier picks up the delivery from the Merchant and/or Partner and during the delivery, the Merchant and/or Partners may be able to see the Courier’s real-time location.</p>
<p>5.3. Sharing between Customers and Merchants</p>
<p>We may share your name, phone number, email address, and/or any physical address associated with your account or any delivery, with the Merchants from whom you’ve placed orders. Merchants may also have access to your public profile image, your feedback, and order information, including your purchase history and other information related to your orders with the particular Merchant. Such information provided to Merchants is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<li>Advertising Partners</li>
</ol>
<p>Third parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed via the Platform may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Platform in order to (a) inform, optimize, and serve marketing content based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (b) report how our marketing content impressions, other uses of marketing services, and interactions with these marketing impressions and marketing services are related to visits to our websites. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick, and others) to serve tailored marketing to you and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Platform. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Platform by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. Cookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed, non-human-readable form.</p>
<p>If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored marketing, you may visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out Link</a>&nbsp;and/or the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Link</a>&nbsp;to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads Settings page</a>. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Platform, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites, accessible by the above links.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Your Choices</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to other choices described in this Privacy Policy and in the Platform, you have other choices regarding your information:</p>
<p><u>Profile Information</u>. You can update your profile information through your profile settings. If you need to change the email address associated with your account, please contact us via mail.</p>
<p><u>Location Information</u>. While you can prevent your device from sharing location information at any time through your device’s operating system settings, Customer and Courier location is core to our Platform and without it, you may not be able to successfully use our Platform.</p>

<ol start="8">
<li>Third-Party Links</li>
</ol>
<p>Our Platform may contain links to other websites, products, or services that we do not have control over. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before giving them your information.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Data Security</li>

<p>Mr. Pengu is not directed to children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe that a child under the age of 13 has given us personal information, please contact us.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Do-Not-Track Disclosure</li>
</ol>
<p>We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Platform for third party purposes. That is why we have provided “Consumer Opt-Out” link, the DAA opt-out link, and a Google opt-out link. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do-Not-Track standards, implementations and solutions.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Consent to Transfer</li>
</ol>
<p>Our computer systems are currently based in Greece, so your personal data will be processed by us in Greece, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. If you create an account with the Platform as a visitor from outside the country, by using the Platform, you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information, which may not offer a level of protection equivalent to that required in certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Your Privacy Rights</li>
</ol>
<p>GDPR Law permits European residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send written notice, by certified mail noting that you are making a “Privacy Request”.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</li>

We encourage Users to read this Privacy Policy periodically to stay up-to-date about our privacy practices. As long as you use the Platform, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy and any updates we make to it.</p>
